MEK Engine

This is my version of the game engine created by The Cherno, as I follow his Game Engine tutorial series.

## Premake
You'll need to download the latest premake executable to generate the project files with ```GenerateProject.bat```.
From the root directory, MEK Engine expects the premake executable to have the following path ```vendor\bin\premake\premake5.exe```.

MEK Engine's premake configuration also expects that you are using the latest version of Visual Studio (currently vs2022).
